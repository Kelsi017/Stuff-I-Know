<h1>The Basics</h1>
<p> I've mostly learned the basic coding of hmtl. I haven't yet gone fully in depth with it, but I find it very interesting and like
working with it.
Most people don't like it but that's only because they don't understand it, and I know I've only scratched the surface but if I already 
really like it know just imagine how much I'll like it later. </p>
